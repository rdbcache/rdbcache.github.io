rdbcache (redis database cache) is an open source database cache server. rdbcache uses redis as cache to offer an asynchronous database cache api service. It provides consistency between redis and database. rdbcache is designed to bridge the gap between redis and database.

The asynchronous nature makes rdbcache very fast and useful in many situations. Through few simple restful API endpoints, rdbcache offers an convenient way for developers to leverage the power of both redis and the database.
